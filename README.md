## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a website for [Sk8NMeet Santana](https://www.instagram.com/sk8_n_meet_santana/) using their requirements. I implemented a way for the team to update the website's content using [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as the content management system (CMS) for creating, editing, and deleting meetups. [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) was used for image hosting and optimization. Its plugin is used inside Sanity Studio and allows the team to choose which photos to use for a new meetup or update existing photos. 

### Highlights

- On-demand incremental static regeneration for static pages with updated / new data
- Sanity content management system for managing data
- Cloudinary image optimization for improving website performance
- Google calendar integration
- Storybook and Figma for wireframes and prototyping
